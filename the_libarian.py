# Project Overview:
# Create a simple library management system where users can add, view, update, and delete 
# books in a file named `the_librarian.py`.

# Requirements:
# Data Storage: Use a list of dictionaries to store book information. Each book should have the following attributes:
# Title (string)
# Author (string)
# Year of publication (int)
# ISBN (string)
# Available (boolean)
# Functions/Actions:
# add_book(): Add a new book to the library.
# view_books(): Display all the books in the library.
# update_book(isbn): Update the information of a book given its ISBN.
# delete_book(isbn): Remove a book from the library using its ISBN.
# search_book(title): Search for a book by its exact title.
# borrow_book(isbn): Mark a book as borrowed (not available).
# return_book(isbn): Mark a book as returned (available).
# User Interface: Use a loop to display a menu and prompt the user for an action above until they choose to exit. Assume the user always inputs the correct data types.
