# 1. Create a function called turn_to_upper(names) that takes in a list of names, and returns a list of names uppercased
# after, print the result of the function.
# For example, if names is ["Winifred", "Wilfred", "Justin", "Augusta"], the result would be [ "WINIFRED", "WILFRED", "JUSTIN", "AUGUSTA"]

# 2. Create a function called get_middle_name that accepts one paramter `name_dict` that takes in a dictionary with keys "first", "middle", and "last".
# The function should return only the middle name.
# For example, if name_dict is {"first": "Tola", "middle": "James", "last": "Akin"}, then the result would be "James". Another example is if name_dict is {"middle": "Chioma", "first": "Ada", "last": "Okeke"}, the result would be "Chioma".

# 3. Create a function called reverse_string that accepts a string as input and returns the string reversed.
# For example, if the string is "Python", the result would be "nohtyP".

# 4. Create a function called count_vowels that accepts a string and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in it.
# For example, if the string is "beautiful", the result would be 5.

# 5. Create a function called even_numbers that takes in a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers.
# For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the result would be [2, 4, 6].

# 6. Create a function called find_max that takes in a list of numbers and returns the maximum number in the list.
# For example, if the list is [12, 45, 3, 67, 23], the result would be 67.

# 7. Create a function called sum_dict_values that takes in a dictionary with numeric values and returns the sum of all the values.
# For example, if the dictionary is {"a": 10, "b": 20, "c": 5}, the result would be 35.

# 8. Create a function called word_lengths that takes in a list of words and returns a dictionary where each word is a key and its length is the value.
# For example, if the list is ["apple", "banana", "cherry"], the result would be {"apple": 5, "banana": 6, "cherry": 6}.

# 9. Create a function called is_palindrome that takes in a string and returns True if the string is a palindrome (same forwards and backwards), otherwise False.
# For example, if the string is "level", the result would be True. If the string is "hello", the result would be False.

# 10. Create a function called merge_lists that takes in two lists and returns one combined list without duplicates.
# For example, if list1 = [1, 2, 3] and list2 = [3, 4, 5], the result would be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

# 11. Create a function called multiply_numbers(a, b=2) that multiplies two numbers.
# If the second number is not provided, it should default to 2.
# Example 1: multiply_numbers(5) → 10
# Example 2: multiply_numbers(5, 3) → 15


# 12. Create a function called greet_user(first_name, last_name="") that returns a greeting string.
# If last_name is not provided, it should only greet with the first name.
# Example 1: greet_user("Ada") → "Hello, Ada!"
# Example 2: greet_user("Tola", "Akin") → "Hello, Tola Akin!"

# 13. Create a function called power(base, exponent=2) that raises the base to the power of the exponent.
# The exponent should default to 2 (square).
# Example 1: power(4) → 16
# Example 2: power(2, 3) → 8

# 14. Create a function called format_full_name(first, middle="", last="") that returns the full name as a single string.
# If middle or last is not provided, it should still work correctly.
# Example 1: format_full_name("John", "Paul", "Smith") → "John Paul Smith"
# Example 2: format_full_name("Ada", last="Okeke") → "Ada Okeke"

# 15. Create a function called calculate_discount(price, discount=10, tax=0) that calculates the final price after applying
# a discount (percentage) and then adding tax (percentage).
# Example 1: calculate_discount(100) → 90.0   (10% discount, no tax)
# Example 2: calculate_discount(200, discount=20, tax=5) → 168.0
